# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ARTIFIOCRACY

## Overview

**Artifiocracy** is not only a new term but also a new form of government and management system that does not rely on electing representatives or parliament. Instead, it uses advanced technology and artificial intelligence to collect and analyze the opinions of each member of the community and derive a decision that reflects their collective will. The decision is then implemented by an executor who has to comply with it.

This system aims to overcome some of the limitations and challenges of traditional forms of democracy, such as low voter turnout, political polarization, corruption, lobbying, misinformation, etc. It also seeks to leverage the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance public policy objectives, service delivery, efficiency, transparency, accountability, and innovation

One of the features of Artifiocracy is that it does not treat the community as a homogeneous entity, but rather recognizes the diversity and complexity of its members. Therefore, it uses advanced technology and artificial intelligence to segment the community into different groups based on various criteria, such as demographics, interests, preferences, values, beliefs, etc. This way, each topic and question that requires a decision can be directed to the most relevant and informed group of people or segments who can provide their opinions on it. This avoids generalizing or imposing an opinion for all types of groups who may have different perspectives or needs on the issue. This also ensures that each group has a voice and a stake in the decision-making process.

This feature aims to improve the quality and legitimacy of the decisions made by Artifiocracy. It also respects the diversity and autonomy of the community members who participate in this system.

We are living in a rapidly changing and complex world that poses new challenges and demands for the current and future generations. The existing system of government and management that we have inherited from the past may not be adequate or suitable for addressing these challenges and meeting these demands. Therefore, we need to envision and create a new system that can overcome the limitations and problems of the existing system and provide a better alternative for the present and future.

However, we acknowledge that building such a new system is not a simple or easy task. It requires a lot of careful thought, research, experimentation, feedback, and refinement. It also requires a lot of collaboration, participation, diversity, and inclusion. That is why we have decided to launch this open-source manifesto that invites everyone who is interested or concerned about this issue to contribute their ideas, opinions, suggestions, criticisms, or questions. We believe that crowdsourcing is the best way to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of the people who will be affected by this new system. We believe that listening to each opinion attentively and respectfully and incorporating their contribution into our vision will help us create a more comprehensive and robust direction for the future.

In this document, we are going to explain the details of Artifiocracy, the systems prior to Artifiocracy, their advantages, and disadvantages, why we need them, what are the blockers, why we need a new system, what is the new system, comparison the new system and prior systems, how to execute them, what are the technical details, what needs to be done, roles, uses cases where to start, etc.&#x20;

Congratulations! You are about to embark on an exciting and amazing journey to a better future. A new era awaits you, us, and them, full of possibilities and opportunities. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey. We are here to draw the new era together. ðŸ˜Š :clap:
